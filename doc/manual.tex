\section{Options}
The options should be put before all expression in the input file.

All options start with ``\%'' or ``\#'' or ``\$'', followed by a word indicate the option name, and then a number or string which is the option value. 

Examples:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{\%number} 1
\item \textbf{\%name} feiwoa
\item \textbf{\%filename} ``exfile 1''
\end{itemize}

As demonstrated in the third example, if there is space in the option value, the quotes should be added.

\subsection{Options that control run procedure}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{\%strategy}
This option control the main run procedure of WPO.

Supported values are the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{kcm}: using kcm method.
\item \textbf{fastrun}: Do simple optimization, which is fast but results are not so good. Recommend for extreme heavy input expressions.
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{\%max\_terms}: This is an option followed by a number,
    which indicates the maximal number of polynomials considered at the same time in Step 2. By default it is set to zero, which means all polynomials are considered at the same time.
        To reduce the running time, it can be set to a number much smaller than the total number of polynomial, like 1000.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Options that control output style}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{\%tmp\_style}
This option controls the output style for temporary variables.

There are two possible values for this option:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{pre}: the declaration of temporary variables will be put before the calculation.
\item \textbf{in}: the declaration of temporary variable will be put when it first appears(recommend, default).
\end{itemize}


\item \textbf{\%func\_style}
This option controls the output style for temporary variables used for functions.

Like \textbf{\%tmp\_style}, ``pre'' and ``in'' are supported.

\item \textbf{\%var\_style}
This option controls the declaration for the target variable, i.e. the variable before '=' in the input file.

Like \textbf{\%tmp\_style}, ``pre'' and ``in'' are supported. Besides these two options, ``no'' is supported, which means that in output file, these variable will not be declared by WPO.

\item \textbf{\%tmp\_prefix}
This is the prefix of the temporarary variable name.
\item \textbf{\%tmp\_suffix}
This is the suffix of the temporary variable name.

\item \textbf{\%num\_prefix}
    This is the prefix of the number(coefficients).
\item \textbf{\%num\_suffix}
    This is the suffix of the number(coefficients). It can be used to convert the number into the type you want. For example, set it to "." can convert it into double type in C++. It can also be used with numeric literals in C++14.

\item \textbf{\%type}
This is the type used in the declaration of temporary variables (and other variables).

\item \textbf{\%line\_prefix}
This is the prefix in each output line.

\item \textbf{\%line\_suffix}
This is the suffix in each output line. Default value for it is ``;'', corresponding to the C programming language.

\item \textbf{\%func\_prefix}
This is the prefix of temporary variables for functions.

\end{itemize}
